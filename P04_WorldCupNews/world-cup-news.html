            The biggest scoreline in the history of the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> qualifiers - and indeed in the history of international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.
        </p>
        <p>
            This legendary match also brought global renown for <cite>Archie Thompson</cite>, whose 13-goal haul set a new world record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.
        </p>
        <p>
            And though defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been that it is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, <cite>&#39Next Goal Wins</cite>&#39, showing across the world.
